# NovaTech Solutions

Demo project for the **Advanced Claude Code** course on Pluralsight.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nyisztor/novatech-demo.git
cd novatech-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Figma Designs (Optional)

For the Figma MCP integration modules, you can duplicate the NovaTech designs to your own Figma account:

**Figma Design File:**  
[https://www.figma.com/design/DU6F0HJvr7XmhGMrNervcs/NovaTech-Solutions?node-id=1-2](https://www.figma.com/design/UZ2t3sc5vi2cn9MXHkOfLY/NovaTech-Solutions?node-id=1-3&t=qQLCM0caT9uCMqJ0-1)

**To use:**
- Click the link (requires free Figma account)
- The design file opens in Figma
- You can inspect, use with MCP, or duplicate to your Drafts if you want your own editable copy

**What's included:**
- Homepage (current design)
- Homepage - Updated (with design changes for demos)

**Note:** This is optional. You can follow along with the videos without opening the file, or practice MCP integration with your own Figma files.

### 3. Setting Up API Tokens

To use the GitHub and Figma MCP servers, you'll need to configure API tokens as environment variables. This keeps your credentials secure and out of version control.

#### 3.1 GitHub Token

**Create a token:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Claude Code MCP"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (for private repos) and `read:org` (for organization access)
5. Click "Generate token" and copy it

**Set the environment variable:**

**macOS (zsh):**
```bash
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
*Note: macOS uses zsh as the default shell*

**Linux (bash):**
```bash
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
*Note: Most Linux systems use bash as the default shell*

**Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt):**
```cmd
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "your_token_here"
```
Then restart your terminal.

*Alternative:* You can also set it through System Properties → Environment Variables → New User variable

#### 3.2 Figma Token (Optional)

**For Remote MCP Server only** (Desktop MCP uses OAuth and doesn't need a token):

**Create a token:**
1. Go to https://www.figma.com/settings
2. Scroll to "Personal access tokens"
3. Click "Generate new token"
4. Give it a name like "Claude Code MCP"
5. Copy the token

**Set the environment variable:**

**macOS (zsh):**
```bash
echo 'export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Linux (bash):**
```bash
echo 'export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
setx FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN "your_token_here"
```
Then restart your terminal.

**Verify tokens are set:**
```bash
# Check GitHub token
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Check Figma token (if configured)
echo $FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

From this point on, these environment variables will be available in every new terminal session, and Claude Code will pick them up automatically when it starts.


### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Open the website
npm run dev

Open: **http://localhost:3000/pages/index.html**

# In another terminal, launch Claude Code
claude
```

## ⚠️ Important: View Hidden Files

This project uses a `.claude/` folder for Claude Code configurations. This folder is **hidden by default** on most operating systems.

**To see hidden files:**

| OS | Method |
|----|--------|
| **macOS** | In Finder: Press `Cmd + Shift + .` |
| **Windows** | In File Explorer: View → Show → Hidden items |
| **VS Code** | Hidden files are visible by default |
| **Linux** | In file manager: `Ctrl + H` or View → Show Hidden Files |
| **Terminal** | Use `ls -la` instead of `ls` |

The `.claude/` folder contains subagents, skills, hooks, and enterprise templates used throughout this course.

## About This Project

NovaTech Solutions is a fictional tech consultancy website. It serves as a hands-on learning environment for advanced Claude Code features:

| Module | Feature | Key Files |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | MCP Server Integration | `.mcp.json` |
| 2 | Subagents | `.claude/agents/` |
| 3 | Git Worktrees | `scripts/setup-worktrees.sh` |
| 4 | Enterprise Features | `.claude/enterprise-templates/` |
| 5 | Agent Skills | `.claude/skills/` |
| 6 | Hooks | `.claude/settings.json` |
